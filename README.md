# PLUCK - Predefined LUA UI Component Kit

Read the docs: **[Documentation](https://playingintraffic.site/docs/pluck)**

## What is PLUCK?

**Formally?** Predefined LUA UI Component Kit
**When it's working great?** Perfect Little UI Component Kit
**When it's not?** Painfully Lame UI Clutter Kit

PLUCK lets you build UI entirely in **Lua**.
No HTML. No CSS. No JavaScript. No problem.

Less "learning React" - more "just show the damn button."

## Who's It For?

- Scripters who **hate coding UI** but still want good-looking panels.
- Developers who'd rather **focus on gameplay**.
- Anyone tired of **context menus pretending to be UI**.
- You. Yes, you.

## Why Use PLUCK?

- **No Bloat** - You only get what you actually use.
- **No Headaches** - Buttons, modals, inputs - they just work.
- **No HTML** - Build everything in clean, readable Lua.
- **Unified Look** - Consistent visuals across your entire server.

## What's Included?

### Main UI Frame

- **Header** - Branding + buttons + whatever chaos you want up top.
- **Footer** - Keybinds, hints, and quick info.
- **Sidebar** - Optional. Menus within menus.
- **Content** - The good stuff.
- **Tooltip** - Hover support out the box.

### Components

- **Buttons** - Smart, modal-aware buttons.
- **Cards** - Display items, jobs, stores, whatever.
- **Inputs** - Full group logic (tuning, clothes, etc).
- **Modal** - With selects, colors, text, number sliders, and more.
- **Namecards** - Beautiful profile-style cards.
- **Notify** - Simple, clean in-UI notifications.

### Extras

## Notes
