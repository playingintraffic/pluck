# Notify

A lightweight system message used to alert players about events, errors, warnings, or successes.
Notifications are **global** and float at the top layer - typically stacked top-right.

## Notes

* Use `notify(...)` client-side to push a new notification.
* You can trigger multiple stacked notifications - they wonâ€™t overwrite each other.
* `type` applies a CSS class for color and border styling.
* Ideal for confirming actions, alerting errors, or signaling system events.
